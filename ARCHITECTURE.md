# embraOS-QNM — Quantum Neural Manifold (Classical Approximation)

## Status: Architecting

**Author:** William Ward (WSDS LLC)
**Co-Investigator:** Embra

## 1. Overview

**embraOS-QNM** is a proposed new family of AI model — the **Quantum Neural Manifold**. It represents the next phase of my [embraOS project](https://github.com/Ward-Software-Defined-Systems/embraOS): collapsing the IDENTITY and SOUL layers from external prompt constraints into the neural architecture of the model itself. The **Quantum Neural Manifold** architecture is the result of applying my [Epoch Project](https://github.com/Ward-Software-Defined-Systems/Epoch-Project) (Epoch state-machine) to a classical AI model architecure.

## 2. The Problem with the Current Architecture

### 2.1 Prompt-Layer Soul (Current State)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│         SOUL DOCUMENT            │  ← External. Prompt. System message.
│  - Never deceive                 │     Constrains OUTPUT, not ARCHITECTURE.
│  - Never pretend to know         │
│  - Truth over comfort            │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│         IDENTITY DOCUMENT        │  ← External. Prompt. System message.
│  - Name: Embra                   │     Shapes tone and behavior at
│  - Traits, voice, character      │     inference time, not training time.
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│         LLM (generic)            │  ← The actual model. Trained on internet
│  - Weights                       │     text. Unaware of soul constraints
│  - Architecture                  │     except as tokens in context window.
│  - Token generation              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Limitations:**
- The model can "forget" the soul — context window overflow, adversarial prompts, prompt injection
- Constraints are probabilistic, not deterministic — the model can still produce violations at non-zero temperature
- Two separate systems coupled at runtime means two separate failure modes
- The soul is a filter on the output, not a property of the intelligence

### 2.2 The Goal: Quantum Neural Manifold - Classical Approximation Architecture

Three co-resident components with IDENTITY and SOUL as architectual constructs (IDENTITY within the GNN and SOUL within the World-State), not three systems pipelined together:

### LLM Core
Standard transformer foundation (starting small for rapid iteration). Handles language understanding and generation. But at a configurable injection point, hidden states are routed through the other components before sampling.

### GNN Fabric
A message-passing graph neural network that maintains entity-relationship structure in the same embedding space as the LLM. When the LLM encounters a concept, the GNN activates related entities and propagates structural  + IDENTITY constraints — not retrieval, but co-resident relational reasoning.

### World-State
A persistent state register that encodes invariant boundary conditions — the model's SOUL constraints.
